## **JavaSerializer**

---

### Overview
Java JSON Serializer is a library designed to simplify the serialization and deserialization of Java objects into JSON format and vice versa. This library leverages the powerful Java Reflection API and Objenesis to handle a wide range of Java object structures, including complex objects with deep hierarchies, custom data types, and more.

### Key Features
- Easy Serialization: Convert Java objects to JSON with a simple API, making it easy to persist data or communicate between different systems.
- Effortless Deserialization: Reconstruct Java objects from JSON strings or files, retaining the original object structure and data.
- Deep Object Handling: Supports deep object hierarchies and complex structures, ensuring accurate serialization and deserialization of nested objects.

### Stack
- Java: The core language used for building the library.
- Reflection API: Utilized to introspect classes at runtime, allowing the library to dynamically access object properties and fields.
- Objenesis: A Java library that allows instantiation of classes without calling their constructors, enabling serialization and deserialization of objects without no-arg constructors.
